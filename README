Some code to simulate the implementation of Shor's algorithm.

To compile and run, you must have at least Java 5 and ant 1.7.
To factor a specific number, eg. 143, use

ant -Dn=143

NOTE: Assumes that n is not a prime power.
Will print the words "Lucky Guess!" if it randomly chooses a prime number by chance!
Will print the "Order" values as it finds them.

Uses the jQuantum library (http://jquantum.sourceforge.net/).
